## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd aram-stats`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
5. PostgreSQL Database Setup:
   - Create a PostgreSQL database on Supabase.
   - In the `getting-started` folder, you'll find the schema for the database in the `schema.sql` file. Use this to set up the necessary tables and structure in your Supabase database.
   - Additionally, you can find a script in the `getting-started` folder to populate the database with data
   - You will need to install cassiopeia and supabase to run the script
   - pip install cassiopeia
   - pip install supabase
   - Run the script and you should have the last 30 games of Aram played by Pobelter in your DB!
6. Configure database: Make a copy of the .env.template called .env and place your URL and Anon key (will also need to do for script)
7. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
8. Access the application at `http://localhost:5173`
